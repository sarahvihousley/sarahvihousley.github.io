      <img src="images/ruleofthirds.jpg" alt="Nike" class="center"> 
    <p>Nike really shows rule of thirds by having the hand go up through the middle left quadrant. This allows the picture to be interesting as well as catch the viewers attention. It allows the audience to view the image as a whole, while focusing on the hand holding a shoe.</p>

      <img src="images/Alignment.jpg" alt="KSL" class="center"> 
    <p>KSL shows proper allignment by breaking up their atricles with even pictures, that will allow for the user to easily navigate and read through the material. It lines up really well and it also ensure that the viewer will remain interested.</p>

    <h2>Contrast</h2>
      <h3>Chick-Fil-A</h3>
    <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com" class="link">chick-fil-a.com</a> 
    <br>
    <img src="images/Contrast.jpg" alt="Chick-Fil-A" class="center"> 
    <p>Chick-Fil-A shows a great example of proper contrast. The red stands out against the image which shows where you should focus your attention to. It allows you to tune in and watch the important aspects of the material. The red also stands out because it is the main color for Chick-Fil-A. It contrast well against the light beige in the background.</p>
